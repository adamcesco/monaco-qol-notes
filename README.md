# monaco-qol-notes

Welcome , the ultimate note-taking application designed to enhance your productivity and streamline your workflow. We bring you major quality-of-life advancements to redefine the way you take notes.

## Installation

## Key Features

*Automatic Topic Analysis:* Analyzes the text within your currently open notes and provides research article recommendations related to the content.

*Picture-in-Picture Note-Taking:* Experience borderless, always-on-top note windows that can be clicked on, edited, and added to, just like picture-in-picture videos.

*Red Mark Reminder:* Never lose your place in a note again. When you move your cursor away, the app leaves an in-text "red mark" in the spot where your cursor was.

*Markdown Visuals:* Enter raw Markdown text, and our app will automatically update the visual components to match the Markdown output equivalent.

*Precise Markdown Rendering:* When your cursor is in a text portion, the Markdown output is removed, revealing the raw Markdown semantics, enhancing editing precision.

*Monaco-Editor Integration:* Enjoy the same key-bindings and cursor controls of VSCode.

*Git and Git-Control:* Implement Git features for version control, including committing, viewing differences between commits, and resetting note projects to previous states.

*Key-bind Portability:* Save and load key-bindings to and from a single file, making it easy to transfer key-bind configurations across devices and share them. We use the same key-bindings file format as VSCode so you can copy paste the same file!

*Table of Contents:* A right-side window displays your file's headings in a formatted structure, acting as a constantly updating table of contents.

*Tab-Based File View:* Each window of the application features tab-based file view management, providing a convenient way to switch between files, even in split views.

*Highlighting Keywords:* Automatically highlight keywords such as "todo:" or "to-do:" in your note files, making task viewing a breeze.
